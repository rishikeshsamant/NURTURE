                <h3><span class="emoji">❓</span>1. What is NURTURE?</h3>
                <p>NURTURE is a safe and supportive online platform designed to help students facing mental health
                    challenges such as stress, anxiety, peer pressure, and time management. We offer expert resources,
                    community support, and valuable tools, all in one place, to help students take control of their
                    well-being. 🧠💪</p>

                <h3><span class="emoji">💡</span>2. Why is NURTURE focused on mental health for students?</h3>
                <p>Students experience unique pressures—academic stress, peer pressure, and self-doubt—that can deeply
                    affect their mental health. Unfortunately, these issues are often overlooked. Our platform shines a
                    light on these hidden struggles and provides a safe space for students to talk, learn, and find
                    solutions. We're here to support you! 💬🌱</p>

                    help students manage mental health issues but if you're facing severe mental health struggles, it's
                    important to consult with a licensed professional or counselor. 💼💙</p>
